            <p>
              The term "cake" has a long history. The word itself is of Viking origin, from the Old Norse word "kaka".[2]

  The ancient Greeks called cake πλακοῦς (plakous), which was derived from the word for "flat", πλακόεις (plakoeis). It was baked using flour mixed with eggs, milk, nuts, and honey. They also had a cake called "satura", which was a flat heavy cake. During the Roman period, the name for cake became "placenta" which was derived from the Greek term. A placenta was baked on a pastry base or inside a pastry case.[3]

Afterwards, put a pressure cooker on high flame and add potato in it along with enough water to submerge the potato in it. Close the lid of the cooker and cook for 2 whistles. Once cooked, let the steam release on its own and then drain the extra water and peel the potato in a bowl, mash it using a masher. Now, wash tomato and capsicum in running water and finely chop them in separate bowls. Peel the onion and thinly slice it in a bowl, keep aside till required.

Put a non-stick pan on medium flame and heat oil in it. Once the oil is hot enough, add cumin and mustard seeds in it, when they start to crackle, add a pinch of asafoetida along with salt.

Now, add garlic paste in the pan and saute for a minute, and quickly add capsicum along with tomato in the pan. Stir to mix all the spices and then add mashed potato in it.

              <p>Put a Tawa on medium flame and when it's mildly hot, carefully transfer the chapati on the heated Tawa. When tiny bubbles start to rise, flip it with a spatula and cook until both sides are golden brown. Apply a little oil on both sides and cook well. Put it aside and repeat the procedure to make more chapatis for the roll. By now, the veggies will be done, switch off the flame and transfer the veggies to a bowl..Take chapati and apply a teaspoon of the green chutney evenly on one side. Then, add sufficient amount of cooked vegetables in the middle of the chapati. Garnish with some raw onion slices and chopped coriander leaves, and wrap it tightly to make a roll. Repeat to make more such Kathi rolls and serve hot!  </p>
